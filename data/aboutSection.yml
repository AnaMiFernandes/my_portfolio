  ### Crafting Customer-Centric Solutions
  
  With a PhD in Systems Biology and rich experience in Data Science, I bring a unique perspective to data, 
  focusing on extracting value and prioritizing the customer. 
  My journey from academia to the tech industry has been driven by a passion for solving challenges and a 
  fascination with the stories  
  
  data can tell.  

  
  My ability to perform insightful experiments and translate complex results into compelling narratives enables
  me to communicate effectively with non-technical stakeholders. I'm dedicated to fostering collaboration and 
  understanding, always aligning data-driven outcomes with customer needs.
