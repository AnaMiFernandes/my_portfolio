  Data Science with purpose

  ### Crafting solutions tailored to customerâ€™s needs
  
  I am a Data Scientist with a passion for solving challenges. 
  My PhD in Systems Biology and my hands-on experience in Data Science have given me 
  a unique perspective on data and how to extract value from it, <br> all while never losing focus of what is most important <br> 
  - the customer. 
  
  
  My knack for performing experiments and distilling their insights into compelling narratives allows me to effectively communicate 
  complex results to non-technical stakeholders. I take it into my own hands to foster collaboration, and promote an understanding of 
  needs and data-driven outcomes.
